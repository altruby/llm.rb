## Compaction

### Introduction

#### Overview

Long-running conversations consume tokens. Without intervention,
every turn pushes toward the model's context window limit. Compaction
drops old messages to keep the conversation alive. The runtime runs
a compactor automatically before each
[`LLM::Agent#talk`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html#talk)
call, trimming the oldest messages when the conversation exceeds a configured size.
This keeps the context window healthy without manual intervention.

#### How it works

Compactors run automatically before each
[`LLM::Agent#talk`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html#talk)
call.
[`LLM::Compactor::Truncate`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Compactor/Truncate.html)
strategy drops the oldest messages, keeping only the N most recent.
It preserves tool call/return pairs so the conversation never
contains an orphaned result.

The `keep:` parameter accepts an integer count or a percentage
string like `"80%"`, and defaults to `64`. When `Truncate` is used
through a context or an agent, `keep:` is given as
`compactor_options: {keep: N}` rather than to the compactor itself.
The default compactor is
[`LLM::Compactor::Null`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Compactor/Null.html),
which does nothing. A compactor can also be used standalone:

```ruby
ctx = LLM::Context.new(
  llm,
  compactor: LLM::Compactor::Truncate,
  compactor_options: {keep: 64}
)

agent = LLM::Agent.new(
  llm,
  compactor: LLM::Compactor::Truncate,
  compactor_options: {keep: 64}
)

compactor = LLM::Compactor::Truncate.new(agent)
compactor.call(keep: 200)
```

##### The `/keep` command

The console provides a `/keep` command that requires a count or
percentage:

```ruby
# /keep 50     # keep last 50 messages
# /keep 75%    # keep approximately 75% of messages
```

#### Why would I use it?

Without compaction, the provider eventually rejects requests because
the context window is full. Compaction keeps the conversation alive
by discarding old messages before they cause a problem.

Long-running agents that span hundreds of turns need this. A bug
investigation that bounces back and forth between diagnosis and
fix cannot fit every exchange in memory. Compaction trims the
unimportant parts and keeps the conversation alive.

#### Notes

The Truncate strategy is fast and has no dependencies. It operates
entirely in memory with a single pass over the message list. The
trade-off is that dropped messages are gone, so information may be
lost. Set `keep` to a higher number to retain more context.

Both strategies accept
[`LLM::Stream#on_compaction`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Stream.html#on_compaction)
and
[`LLM::Stream#on_compaction_finish`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Stream.html#on_compaction_finish)
stream callbacks so the UI can show progress, but only the `Truncate`
strategy emits them. `Null` performs no compaction and emits nothing.
The context's
[`LLM::Context#compacted?`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Context.html#compacted?)
flag is `true` between compaction and the next model response.
