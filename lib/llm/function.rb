# The {LLM::Function LLM::Function} class represents a local
# function that can be called by an LLM. Most users should define
# tools as subclasses of {LLM::Tool} instead — Function is the
# lower-level building block that Tool wraps.
#
# @example Tool subclass (preferred for most users)
#   class ReadFile < LLM::Tool
#     name "read-file"
#     description "Read a file from disk"
#     parameter :path, String, "The filename or path"
#     required %i[path]
#
#     def call(path:)
#       {contents: File.read(path)}
#     end
#   end
#
# @example Inline function (block-form DSL)
#   LLM.function(:run_command) do |fn|
#     fn.name "run-command"
#     fn.description "Runs a shell command"
#     fn.params do |schema|
#       schema.object(command: schema.string.required)
#     end
#     fn.define do |command:|
#       {success: Kernel.system(command)}
#     end

  # {LLM::Function::Return LLM::Function::Return} represents the result of a
  # tool call.
  #
  # In llm.rb, tool execution is not complete until the requested function is
  # answered with a return object and that return is sent back through the
  # context. This is the object that closes that loop.
  #
  # The return carries:
  # - the tool call ID
  # - the tool name
  # - the tool's return value
  #
  # That value is usually a `Hash`, but it can be any JSON-like structure your
  # tool returns. `LLM::Function#call` produces one automatically, and
  # `LLM::Function#cancel` produces one that represents a cancelled tool call.
  #
  # You can also construct one directly when you need to intercept, scrub, or
  # synthesize a tool return before sending it back to the model.
  #
  # @example Returning a normal tool result
  #   ret = LLM::Function::Return.new("call_1", "weather", {forecast: "sunny"})
